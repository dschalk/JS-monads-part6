Web/Cookie.hs:42:1: Warning:
    The import of ‘Data.Monoid’ is redundant
      except perhaps to import instances from ‘Data.Monoid’
    To import instances alone, use: import Data.Monoid()

    In the use of ‘S.breakByte’ (imported from Data.ByteString):
    Deprecated: "It is an internal function and should never have been exported. Use 'break (== x)' instead. (There are rewrite rules that handle this special case of 'break'.)"

Web/Cookie.hs:241:21: Warning:
